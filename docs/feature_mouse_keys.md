# Mouse keys

Mouse keys is a feature that allows you to emulate a mouse using your
keyboard. You can move the pointer at different speeds, press 8 buttons and
scroll in 8 directions.

## Adding mouse keys to your keyboard

To use mouse keys, you must at least enable mouse keys support and map mouse
actions to keys on your keyboard.

### Enabling mouse keys

To enable mouse keys, add the following line to your keymap’s `rules.mk`:

```c
MOUSEKEY_ENABLE = yes
```

### Mapping mouse actions

In your keymap you can use the following keycodes to map key presses to
mouse actions:

|Key             |Aliases  |Description      |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|
|`KC_MS_UP`      |`KC_MS_U`|Move cursor up   |
|`KC_MS_DOWN`    |`KC_MS_D`|Move cursor down |
|`KC_MS_LEFT`    |`KC_MS_L`|Move cursor left |
|`KC_MS_RIGHT`   |`KC_MS_R`|Move cursor right|
|`KC_MS_BTN1`    |`KC_BTN1`|Press button 1   |
|`KC_MS_BTN2`    |`KC_BTN2`|Press button 2   |
|`KC_MS_BTN3`    |`KC_BTN3`|Press button 3   |
|`KC_MS_BTN4`    |`KC_BTN4`|Press button 4   |
|`KC_MS_BTN5`    |`KC_BTN5`|Press button 5   |
|`KC_MS_BTN6`    |`KC_BTN6`|Press button 6   |
|`KC_MS_BTN7`    |`KC_BTN7`|Press button 7   |
|`KC_MS_BTN8`    |`KC_BTN8`|Press button 8   |
|`KC_MS_WH_UP`   |`KC_WH_U`|Move wheel up    |
|`KC_MS_WH_DOWN` |`KC_WH_D`|Move wheel down  |
|`KC_MS_WH_LEFT` |`KC_WH_L`|Move wheel left  |
|`KC_MS_WH_RIGHT`|`KC_WH_R`|Move wheel right |
|`KC_MS_ACCEL0`  |`KC_ACL0`|Set speed to 0   |
|`KC_MS_ACCEL1`  |`KC_ACL1`|Set speed to 1   |
|`KC_MS_ACCEL2`  |`KC_ACL2`|Set speed to 2   |

## Configuring mouse keys

Mouse keys supports several movement modes:

* **Accelerated `MK_TYPE_X11` (default):** Holding movement keys accelerates
  the cursor linearly until it reaches its maximum speed. Additionally
  holding down acceleration keys immediately moves the cursor at quarter,
  half, or full speed.
* **Combined `MK_TYPE_X11_COMBINED`:** As above, but acceleration keys
  select between the minimum, half, or the maximum possible (≥ full) speed.
* **Kinetic `MK_TYPE_KINETIC`:** Holding movement keys applies a constant
  accelerating force, but the cursor also experiences drag and friction.
  That is, initially the speed will increase linearly—and hence movements
  quadratically—until the effects of drag (proportional to speed²) take
  over. Releasing movement keys allows drag & friction to slow the cursor
  down to a standstill after some time.
* **Constant `MK_TYPE_3_SPEED`:** Holding movement keys moves the cursor at
  a constant speed. Acceleration keys select between different predetermined
  speeds.
* **Momentary `MK_TYPE_3_SPEED_MOMENTARY`:** As above, but acceleration keys
  act only while held down.

The same principle applies to the scroll wheel.

Configuration options that are times, intervals or delays are given in
milliseconds. Scroll speed is given as multiples of the default scroll step.
For example, a scroll speed of 8 means that each scroll action covers
8 times the length of the default scroll step as defined by your operating
system or application.

To select all but the default mode, you _must_ define `MK_VARIANT`
accordingly in your keymap’s `config.h` file:

```c
#define MK_VARIANT MK_TYPE_X11
#define MK_VARIANT MK_TYPE_X11_COMBINED
#define MK_VARIANT MK_TYPE_KINETIC
#define MK_VARIANT MK_TYPE_3_SPEED
#define MK_VARIANT MK_TYPE_3_SPEED_MOMENTARY
```

### Accelerated & combined modes: `MK_TYPE_X11` & `MK_TYPE_X11_COMBINED`

This is the default mode when `MK_VARIANT` is not defined. You can adjust
the cursor and scrolling acceleration using the following settings in your
keymap’s `config.h` file:

|Define                      |Default|Description                                              |
|:---------------------------|------:|:--------------------------------------------------------|
|`MOUSEKEY_DELAY`            |    300|Delay between pressing a movement key and cursor movement|
|`MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL`         |     50|Time between cursor movements in milliseconds            |
|`MOUSEKEY_MOVE_DELTA`       |      5|Step size                                                |
|`MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED`        |     10|Maximum cursor speed at which acceleration stops         |
|`MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX`      |     20|Time until maximum cursor speed is reached               |
|`MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_DELAY`      |    300|Delay between pressing a wheel key and wheel movement    |
|`MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_INTERVAL`   |    100|Time between wheel movements                             |
|`MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_MAX_SPEED`  |      8|Maximum number of scroll steps per scroll action         |
|`MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_TIME_TO_MAX`|     40|Time until maximum scroll speed is reached               |

Tips:

* Setting `MOUSEKEY_DELAY` too low makes the cursor unresponsive. Setting it
  too high makes small movements difficult.
* For smoother cursor movements, lower the value of `MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL`. If
  the refresh rate of your display is 60Hz, you could set it to `16` (1/60).
  As this raises the cursor speed significantly, you may want to lower
  `MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED`.
* Setting `MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX` or `MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_TIME_TO_MAX` to `0` will
  disable acceleration for the cursor or scrolling respectively. This way
  you can make one of them constant while keeping the other accelerated,
  which is not possible in constant speed mode.
* Setting `MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_INTERVAL` too low will make scrolling too fast.
  Setting it too high will make scrolling too slow when the wheel key is
  held down.

Cursor acceleration uses the same algorithm as the X11 Window System
MouseKeysAccel feature, although the ‘`curve`’ parameter has not been
implemented yet. You can read more about it [on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_keys).

#### Combined mode `MK_TYPE_X11_COMBINED`

This mode functions like **Accelerated** mode, however, you can hold
`KC_ACL0`, `KC_ACL1` and `KC_ACL2` to momentarily (while held) set the
cursor and scroll speeds to constant speeds. When no acceleration keys are
held, this mode is identical to **Accelerated** mode, and can be modified
using all of the relevant settings.

* **KC_ACL0:** This acceleration sets your cursor to the slowest possible
  speed. This is useful for very small and detailed movements of the cursor.
* **KC_ACL1:** This acceleration sets your cursor to half the full (user
  defined) speed.
* **KC_ACL2:** This acceleration sets your cursor to the maximum possible
  (127 pixels per `MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL`) speed. This is useful for moving the
  cursor large distances without much accuracy.

### Kinetic Mode `MK_TYPE_KINETIC`

This mode models mouse cursor and wheel movements with a [numerically
approximated][euler] [physical simulation][ode], accounting for [drag][drag]
and [kinetic friction][fric].

Host updates are sent as often as possible, limited only by
[`USB_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`](config_options.md).

> The kinetic mode uses a quadratic curve on the cursor speed which allows
> precise movements at the beginning and allows to cover large distances by
> increasing cursor speed quickly thereafter.

You can adjust the mouse cursor and wheel parameters with the following
settings in your keymap’s `config.h` file:

|Define                 |Default|Description                          |
|:----------------------|------:|:------------------------------------|
|`MK_KINETIC_MOUSE_ACCN`|     24|Acceleration for mouse cursor        |
|`MK_KINETIC_MOUSE_DRAG`|     16|Drag coefficient for mouse cursor    |
|`MK_KINETIC_MOUSE_FRIC`|     32|Friction coefficient for mouse cursor|
|`MK_KINETIC_MOUSE_MAXS`|    128|Maximum speed for mouse cursor       |
|`MK_KINETIC_WHEEL_ACCN`|     16|Acceleration for mouse wheel         |
|`MK_KINETIC_WHEEL_DRAG`|      8|Drag coefficient for mouse wheel     |
|`MK_KINETIC_WHEEL_FRIC`|      8|Friction coefficient for mouse wheel |
|`MK_KINETIC_WHEEL_MAXS`|     12|Maximum speed for mouse wheel        |

All parameters can be set to their full range of `0`–`255`.

* `ACCN` controls the acceleration while movement keys are held down, and is
  scaled by √½× for diagonal movements. Setting this to `0` corresponds to
  an accelerating force that exactly balances out the friction component.

* `FRIC` controls the deceleration due to [Coulombian kinetic friction][fric].
  Setting this to `255` should bring the cursor to a standstill within FIXME
  1ms even in the absence of drag.

* `DRAG` controls [an additional contribution][drag] to deceleration when
  moving at high speeds, but becomes negligible at slow speeds.
  FIXME ∝v²

* `MAXS` sets the number of pixels moved in 15ms, when the internal model has 
  has reached its
  at its maximum velocity.

The `MAXS` parameter can be tweaked during use:

* **KC_ACL0:** Scales `MAXS` to ½× of normal while held down, which can help
  with more accurate cursor placement. Resets back to 1× when released.
* **KC_ACL1:** Each tap progressively halves (rounding up) `MAXS`—down to
  `1`—giving even finer movements.
* **KC_ACL2:** Each tap progressively doubles `MAXS`, up to `255`.

ProTip: after scaling `MAXS` with `KC_ACL1` or `KC_ACL2`, you can tap
`KC_ACL0` to reset it back to 1×.

### Constant & momentary modes

In this mode you can define multiple different speeds for both the cursor
and the mouse wheel. There is no acceleration. `KC_ACL0`, `KC_ACL1` and
`KC_ACL2` change the cursor and scroll speed to their respective setting.

You can choose whether speed selection is momentary or tap-to-select:

* **Momentary `MK_TYPE_3_SPEED_MOMENTARY`:** The chosen speed is only active
  while you hold the respective key. When the key is raised, mouse keys
  returns to the unmodified speed. Default speeds: `KC_ACL0` < `KC_ACL1`
  < *unmodified* < `KC_ACL2`
* **Tap-to-select `MK_TYPE_3_SPEED`:** The chosen speed is activated when
  you press the respective key and remains active even after the key has
  been raised. The default speed is that of `KC_ACL1`. There is no
  unmodified speed. Default speeds: `KC_ACL0` < `KC_ACL1` < `KC_ACL2`

The following settings are available for adjusting cursor movement or scrolling:

|Define               |Default|Description                                |
|:--------------------|------:|:------------------------------------------|
|`MK_C_OFFSET_UNMOD`  |     16|Cursor offset per movement (unmodified)    |
|`MK_C_INTERVAL_UNMOD`|     16|Time between cursor movements (unmodified) |
|`MK_C_OFFSET_0`      |      1|Cursor offset per movement (`KC_ACL0`)     |
|`MK_C_INTERVAL_0`    |     32|Time between cursor movements (`KC_ACL0`)  |
|`MK_C_OFFSET_1`      |      4|Cursor offset per movement (`KC_ACL1`)     |
|`MK_C_INTERVAL_1`    |     16|Time between cursor movements (`KC_ACL1`)  |
|`MK_C_OFFSET_2`      |     32|Cursor offset per movement (`KC_ACL2`)     |
|`MK_C_INTERVAL_2`    |     16|Time between cursor movements (`KC_ACL2`)  |
|`MK_W_OFFSET_UNMOD`  |      1|Scroll steps per scroll action (unmodified)|
|`MK_W_INTERVAL_UNMOD`|     40|Time between scroll steps (unmodified)     |
|`MK_W_OFFSET_0`      |      1|Scroll steps per scroll action (`KC_ACL0`) |
|`MK_W_INTERVAL_0`    |    360|Time between scroll steps (`KC_ACL0`)      |
|`MK_W_OFFSET_1`      |      1|Scroll steps per scroll action (`KC_ACL1`) |
|`MK_W_INTERVAL_1`    |    120|Time between scroll steps (`KC_ACL1`)      |
|`MK_W_OFFSET_2`      |      1|Scroll steps per scroll action (`KC_ACL2`) |
|`MK_W_INTERVAL_2`    |     20|Time between scroll steps (`KC_ACL2`)      |

### Inertia mode

This mode provides smooth motion, like sliding on ice.  The cursor accelerates
along a quadratic curve while a key is held, then glides to a stop after the
key is released.  Vertical and horizontal movements are tracked independently,
so the cursor can move in many directions and make curves.

Cannot be used at the same time as Kinetic mode, Constant mode, or Combined mode.

Recommended settings in your keymap’s `config.h` file:

|Define                      |Default  |Description                                                |
|----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`MOUSEKEY_INERTIA`          |undefined|Enable Inertia mode                                        |
|`MOUSEKEY_DELAY`            |150      |Delay between pressing a movement key and cursor movement  |
|`MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL`         |16       |Time between cursor movements in milliseconds (16 = 60fps) |
|`MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED`        |32       |Maximum cursor speed at which acceleration stops           |
|`MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX`      |32       |Number of frames until maximum cursor speed is reached     |
|`MOUSEKEY_FRICTION`         |24       |How quickly the cursor stops after releasing a key         |
|`MOUSEKEY_MOVE_DELTA`       |1        |How much to move on first frame (1 strongly recommended)   |

Tips:

* Set `MOUSEKEY_DELAY` to roughly the same value as your host computer's key repeat delay, in ms.  Recommended values are 100 to 300.
* Set `MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL` to a value of 1000 / your monitor's FPS.  For 60 FPS, 1000/60 = 16.
* Set `MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED` based on your screen resolution and refresh rate, like Width / FPS.  For example, 1920 pixels / 60 FPS = 32 pixels per frame.
* Set `MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX` to a value of approximately FPS / 2, to make it reach full speed in half a second (or so).
* Set `MOUSEKEY_FRICTION` to something between 1 and 255.  Lower makes the cursor glide longer. Values from 8 to 40 are the most effective.
* Keep `MOUSEKEY_MOVE_DELTA` at 1.  This allows precise movements before the gliding effect starts.
* Mouse wheel options are the same as the default accelerated mode, and do not use inertia.

## Use with PS/2 Mouse and Pointing Device

Mouse keys button state is shared with [PS/2 mouse](feature_ps2_mouse.md)
and [pointing device](feature_pointing_device.md) so mouse keys button
presses can be used for clicks and drags.
